# Digital Humanities GIS Projects Map

This code creates a map of Digital Humanities GIS projects using data gathered from [this list](https://anterotesis.com/wordpress/mapping-resources/dh-gis-projects/). The data includes the project name, URL, location, and coordinates. SmartMonkey was used for geocoding. The map is created using the Folium library and displays markers for each project with a popup label showing details.

I am dedicated to exploring the intersection of digital humanities and geographic information systems (GIS). My goal is to create a comprehensive map of research institutes around the world that are conducting DH GIS projects, along with the location of their research subjects and the categories of DH GIS projects they are working on.

I believe that mapping the locations of research institutes, their research subjects, and the categories of DH GIS projects will provide valuable insights into the current state of the field and help researchers and practitioners connect and collaborate on new and existing projects.

I have carefully curated the data to ensure the accuracy and relevance of my map. I am confident that this resource will be an invaluable tool for anyone interested in the digital humanities and GIS. So, whether you're a researcher, practitioner, or simply curious, I invite you to explore my map and discover the exciting world of DH GIS projects!
