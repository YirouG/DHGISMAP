# Digital Humanities GIS Projects Map

This code creates a map of Digital Humanities GIS projects using data gathered from [this list](https://anterotesis.com/wordpress/mapping-resources/dh-gis-projects/). The data includes the project name, URL, location, and coordinates. SmartMonkey was used for geocoding. The map is created using the Folium library and displays markers for each project with a popup label showing details.
